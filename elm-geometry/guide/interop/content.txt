Since `elm-geometry` uses the `Quantity` type from
[`elm-units`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-units/latest/)
to represent point coordinates and vector components, a bit of extra work is
required when working with other code that uses plain `Float` values:

- When converting *from* plain `Float` values, you must provide a unit
  conversion function such as `Length.feet` that takes a `Float` and produces a
  `Quantity Float units`.
- When converting *to* plain `Float` values, you must provide a unit conversion
  function such as `Length.inFeet` that takes a `Quantity Float units` and
  produces a `Float`.

For example, to construct a `Point2d` representing an on-screen point with
coordinates in pixels, you might use

```elm
point =
    Point2d.fromTuple Pixels.pixels ( 200, 300 )
```
